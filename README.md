# JavaScript Null Value Handling and Error Propagation

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when dealing with null values and provides a solution for more robust error handling.

The `bug.js` file contains code that checks for null values in the inputs, but doesn't comprehensively handle the potential null return value in the calling code.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates better error handling and shows how to address the issue by checking for null and providing appropriate feedback or alternative actions.

## Bug
The primary issue is that while the function `foo` handles `null` inputs, it doesn't prevent the propagation of the null value to subsequent code that might not expect it, possibly leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. 

## Solution
The solution focuses on explicitly handling the potential `null` return value from the function `foo` in the calling code.  It presents ways to prevent the program from unexpectedly terminating or producing unexpected results.
